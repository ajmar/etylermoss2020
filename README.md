My website, built using Gatsby (based on gatsby-default-starter), as well as TypeScript and Theme-ui. Still a work in progress.

_Have another more specific idea? You may want to check out our vibrant collection of [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## ðŸš€ Quick start

    How to run the development server (including type checking):

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/etylermoss/etylermoss.com.git
	cd etylermoss.com/
    npm run develop
    ```

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
